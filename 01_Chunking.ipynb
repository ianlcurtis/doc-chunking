    "# File Chunking\n",
    "Partitioning large documents into smaller chunks can help you stay under the maximum token input limits of embedding models. For example, the maximum length of input text for the [Azure OpenAI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/embeddings) embedding models is 8,191 tokens. Given that each token is around four characters of text for common OpenAI models, this maximum limit is equivalent to around 6,000 words of text. If you're using these models to generate embeddings, it's critical that the input text stays under the limit. Partitioning your content into chunks ensures that your data can be processed by the embedding models used to populate vector stores and text-to-vector query conversions.\n",
